2 Versions of a Meat timer application, one using Tkinter and the other using CustomTKinter for a more modern effect.

App allows users to choose a form of meat [Beef(with rarities), Chicken, or Pork] and recommends a cooking time based on weight and proposed 
temperature.

For now the assumed cooking method is baking (or just in the oven).

There are no functional differences bettween the two versions, just one looks better than the other.

Thanks!
